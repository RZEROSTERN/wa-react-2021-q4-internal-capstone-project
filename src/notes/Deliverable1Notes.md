# Notes for Deliverables

## Deliverable 1

1. I'm working the Home view as a class and the header and footer as exported functions. Want to know what is the best approach according to best practices.
2. The mocks folder has been integrated to src due React restrictions of working outside the src folder.
3. The slider should be refactored for getting its items as components. Will be available in next iteration.
